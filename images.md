IMAGE SIZE: 960x320

Here is what I found to work around the limitation of iPhoto:
* Resize the photo in Preview first, so that the width of the picture is what you want.
* Then import to iPhoto.
* Click on edit, and choose crop.
* Choose "custom" and constrain, then enter the number of pixels you want to crop to with the actual width of photo as the first number. Then hit tab to the cancel button. (this is where the problem happens, as the number is correct but the "crop window" doesn't fill the photo)
* Then DO NOT complete the crop but hit cancel after having tabbed to it.
* Immediately after hitting cancel, hit the crop button again and choose "custom" & select the constrain box, this time the width of the "crop window" will be correct.
